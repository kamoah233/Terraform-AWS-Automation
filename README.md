# Terraform-AWS-Automation

This project shows how to design and deploy AWS infrastructure using Terraform.

My goal here is to demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices by provisioning a simple yet scalable cloud environment.

# Overview

I automate the creation of:
- A secure VPC with private and public subnets
- An EC2 instance
- An S3 Bucket
- IAM roles and policies
- Outputs for easy integrations with other tools 

## Tools and Technologies
- **Terraform**
- **AWS** (VPC, EC2, IAM, S3)
- **AWS CLI**
- **GitHub**
